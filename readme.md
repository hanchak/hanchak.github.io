# WebScraping
## with jupyter notebook

This is a simple repository for web scraping with Jupyter Notebook.

The notebook code is [here](https://github.com/hanchak/WebScrape/blob/master/ScrapeTheWeather.ipynb). 
It's based off of code I found at this [site](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/).
