## Oct 2017
I just started using [pyzo](http://www.pyzo.org/) as a python IDE. I like that it is much faster to load than spyder and has a nice looking interface. 

## Sep 2017
Thought I would try my hand at GitHub and GitHub pages.  This is the result.

# Projects:

## WebScraping with Jupyter Notebook

[This](https://github.com/hanchak/WebScrape) is a simple repository for web scraping with Jupyter Notebook.
The notebook code can be found [here](https://github.com/hanchak/WebScrape/blob/master/ScrapeTheWeather.ipynb). 
It's based off of code I found at this [site](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/).

## Physics-based Simulations

Also, [here](https://github.com/hanchak/physics) is a repository for physics-based simulations using python.  I use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution with the included [spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) IDE when I need to quickly and repeatedly run code, as well as for debugging.
